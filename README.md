# Ticketing System

### Technology

**Frontend :** React 19  
**Backend :** ASP.NET Core 8  
**Database :** Postgres  
**Database visualizer :** pgAdmin


### Setup:

`docker compose up -d`

Given the constraints I was in, I wasn't able to finish the app:
- Currently the api and the frontend work seperately
- Followed service architecture instead of CQRS, which seemed a bit overkill
- Applied most of the DDD in the backend side
- United tests in frontend were not done
